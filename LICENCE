You don't need to include this license in redistribution.  Use it to build a baby monitor for your neighbor.  Hack it apart and build it back up to make an intercom for your front door.  Preinstall it on Raspberry Pis you sell on ebay and give me no credit.  Tell your friends you're the REAL genius behind it so you can get their validation.  Clone the repo and pretend you made it.  I don't care!  Just try to to be a dick and make cool things.  I just like to write code and share it sometimes and I don't care about licensing.cd rpi-int
